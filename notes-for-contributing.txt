Adding a new rule category:

- create a subdirectory of the `_rules` directory.
- add a new entry to the `_data/ruletypes.yml` file with the subdirectory name as the value for `directory` and a title in Titlecase.
- start adding rule entries to the subdirectory

- the new category and the rules adde will automatically be added to the menu.

- Internal references should be linked like this `[dead code]: {{ '/good-practices/no-dead-code/' | prepend: site.clearphp.url }}`

- If you move a rule from one rule type to another, make sure you add a redirect for the old url in .htaccess


Styleguide:
* Wrap function names in sentences in backticks and add `()`. Wrap language constructs in sentences in backticks, but do *not* add `()`.
* Wrap code blocks in highlight tags. All code blocks should start with `<?php` - the code should start on the next line directly after that. Code blocks should not have a closing tag `?>` and should have a blank line before the closing highlight tag and two blank lines after.
* If for a specific example it is important to show the opening (and/or closing) php tag, add the `.short` class by adding {: .short } after the highlight end tag. So named as this normally will only apply to short samples such as: `<?= echo $a ?>`.
* Specific code blocks demonstrating good/bad code should have appropriate style classes.
* Always use language agnostic permalinks when using external urls.
