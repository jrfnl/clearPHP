Reference for writing clear PHP code

It is difficult to know when one's code is well written. There are recommendations for writing PHP code in the manual, from CS theories, peer review, and gut feeling. That makes for a lot of rules.

The main goal of this document is to collect such rules, so as to have them all available in an easy to read format and select them for reviewing one's code. This is a reference document, in which anyone may look for ways to improve their code.

So Many Rules
------------------------------------
There are obviously a lot of rules. And probably some more will be added soon. 


* This is no ultimate coding standard : claiming that any code is 100% compatible with the current reference is futile. No medals are eventually distributed. 
* Don't use them all : it would be difficult to apply them all at the same time in one's code. This is because some rules generate too many observations (try to educate quotes), some may be contradictory. 
* It is fine to hate some rules : this is a reference. Its first goal is to collect the rules, their description, their advantages and drawbacks. After this, you'll be able to adopt some of them. This also means that you will dislike some rules : that is OK.
