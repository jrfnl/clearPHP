## Reference for writing clear PHP code

It is difficult to know when one's code is well written. There are recommendations for writing PHP code in the manual, from CS theories, peers review, and gut feeling. That makes a lot of rules. 

The main goal of this repository is to collect such rules, so as to have them all easy to read and select them for reviewing one's code. This is a reference document, in which anyone may look for ways to improve their code.

The rules are available in an easily readable format via the website <http://clearphp.io>
