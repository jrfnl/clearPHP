# No Unresolved Use Statement

`use` statements provide the ability to refer to an external fully qualified name. Since it will be used to locate definitions in other namespaces and/or files, it is important to check the validity of the fully qualified name.

```php
<?php

namespace X;

use AnotherNamespace\Aclass;
use AnotherNamespace\Subnamespace;

$a = new Aclass();

```


PHP will not check the validity of `use` at compile time, but at execution time. It will then raise a fatal error.

It is recommended to make sure that `use` statement are always pointing to an existing definition.


## Rule Details

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```php
<?php

namespace X;

use AnotherNamespace\UndefinedClass;

```
