# Use Constant Rather Than Function

Some PHP functions have a constant counterpart. This constant is usually faster, or more convenient to use. 


| Function  | Constant  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| php\_sapi\_name  | PHP\_SAPI  | Type of interface used  |
| phpversion  | PHP\_VERSION  | Version of the current PHP  |
| `fopen('php://stdin', 'r')`  | STDIN  | Stream is already opened. (CLI version) |
| `fopen('php://stdout', 'w')`  | STDOUT  | Stream is already opened. (CLI version) |
| `fopen('php://stderr', 'w')`  | STDERR  | Stream is already opened. (CLI version) |


It is recommended to make sure the constant version.

## Rule Details

The following patterns is considered a warning:

```php
<?php

if (php_sapi_name() == 'cli') {
	/**/
}

?>
```

The following patterns is considered valid :

```php
<?php

if (PHP_SAPI == 'cli') {
	/**/
}

?>
```
