# No Exit

It is possible to end the execution of a script with `die` and `exit` functions. They will interrupt the execution and destruct all resources. 

```php
<?php

if (mysql_connect('localhost', 'user', 'pass')) {
	die('No database');
}

```

Exiting a script this way will also break any library that is including the `die` or `exit`. This may be difficult to spot, especially if those functions are used without any argument, thus displaying nothing about the location of the exit. 

It is usually better to `throw` an exception or raise an error (with `trigger_error`) or use any error handling set up available (returning a value, calling a `error` method, etc..). 

 

## Rule Details


```php
<?php

exit();
die(__METHOD__);

```

Rule may also apply to libraries build on top of `var_dump` concept, such as [Kint](http://raveren.github.io/kint/) or [Krumo](http://krumo.sourceforge.net/). They provide configuration to disable them while leaving debug traces in the code, which is not the case for native PHP functions such as `print_r`. While this is indeed better, this still mean code that won't be used is pushed to production. As such, it must be avoided. 


## When Not To Use It
When the code is run as a commandline script, `exit` and `die` are good to return status, just like `return`.
