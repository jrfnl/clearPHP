# Always Use Semicolon

PHP uses semicolon `;` to make distinction between two sequential instructions. 

```php
<?php

$a = 'a';
echo $a;

```

There are a few situations where semicolon are not required, as another token will be used as instruction ending. For example : 

```php
<?php echo 'a' ?>
```
Here, the `echo 'a'` instruction will be closed automatically by the `?>` PHP closing tag. 

In some situations, the missing `;` will make PHP starts the instruction on one line and finish on the next. 


```php
<?php

$a = f() or 
	// $a = b()      // This line was simply commented out
if ($condition) {}	// now the 'if' is depend on the f() call
	
echo 
print 'b';
// This will display b1

```
`continue` and `break` used to accept no value (that will default to 1) or the result of the next expression (up to PHP 5.4) : 

```php
<?php

for ( $i = 0; $i < 5; ++$i )
{
    if ( $i == 2 )
        continue
    print "$i\n";
    // surprising result
}

```
There are quite some instructions that may overflow to the next line, like all operators, and : 
* all operators (math, comparison, logical...)
* `echo`
* `print`
* `include` and `include_once`
* `require` and `require_once`
* `exit`

This rules doesn't require the adding of extra semicolon when they are not needed.

```php
<?php

for ( $i = 0; $i < 5; ++$i ) { }; // useless semicolon

class x { }; // useless semicolon

```

It is recommended to make sure that all required semicolon are always set, even if they are not compulsory.

## Rule Details

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```php
<?php echo $a ?>
<?= 3 ?>
```

The following code is not considered warnings:

```php
<?php
include 
	'/some/file.php';

```
