# No Assign Null From Method

PHP functions and methods may return `null` by not returning at all, or returning it explicitly. When they do so, the function may be called but no result should be assigned to a variable, as this is a waste of memory. 

Methods that return `null` or some other result are not considered in this rule. 

## Rule Details

The following are considered a warning : 

```php
<?php

function x() { /* do Something Without Return */ }
function y() { /* do Something Without Return */; return null; }

$a = x();
$b[] = y();

?>
```

The following are OK : 

```php
<?php

function x($a) { 
	if ($a) {
		return 1;
	}  else {
		return null;
	}
}

$a = x(1);

?>
```
