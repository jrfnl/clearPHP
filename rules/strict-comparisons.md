# Strict Comparisons

PHP makes a effort at simplifying the programmer's life by automatically casting the values in a comparison to a comparable type. 

```php
<?php
$x = 0;
if ($x == false) { /* doSomething */ }
?>
```
## Frequent Error

Here, equaling `0` to `false` seems quite natural. Under the hood, PHP does turn the integer `0` to the equivalent as a boolean, which is `false`. The comparison then succeeds. 

```php
<?php
$x = strpos('abc', 'a');
if ($x == false) { /* process error */ } else { /* process finding */}
?>
```
Things gets a little more confusing when some information is carried by the type of the value. Here, `strpos` will return `false` if it can't find the needle (`'a'`) in the haystack (`'abc'`). But it will also return `0` if it finds the needle in the first position, which is indexed with 0. 

## Security Error

The `==` and `!=` are also a weakness when dealing with passwords. Usually, passwords are not compared directly, but after hashing, using methods like haval, tiger or ripemd128 (Older code may rely on MD5, SHA1 or CRC32). All those hash are strings, containing numbers and letters.

```php
<?php
echo hash('ripemd128','315655854',false);
// 0e251331818775808475952406672980
?>
```

When the hash value starts with a `0e`, and is compared using `==` and `!=`, then PHP will first convert the operands to integers before comparing them. This will turn both operands to 0, and even if the strings are not identical, the comparison will conclude so.

```php
<?php
if (hash('ripemd128','315655854',false) == "0e123") {
	print "Matched\n";
};
?>
```

## Recommendations

The recommendation is to use `===` or `!==` by default, anywhere there are no good reason to use `==` or `!=`. Always compare the returned value to `false` or `true` explicitly.

As for password related operations, it is also recommended to use `password_hash` and `password_verify` functions.

## Rule Details

This rule targets methods that doesn't compare the result with `===` or `!==` to  `false` or `true`.

Here is a list of PHP native functions that require strict comparison : 

* array\_search
* collator\_compare
* collator\_get\_sort\_key
* current
* fgetc
* file\_get\_contents
* file\_put\_contents
* iconv\_strpos
* iconv\_strrpos
* imagecolorallocate
* imagecolorallocatealpha
* mb\_strlen
* next
* pcntl\_getpriority
* preg\_match
* preg\_match\_all
* prev
* readdir
* stripos
* strpos
* strripos
* strrpos
* strtok

The following code is considered a warning:

```php
<?php

// implicit comparisons
if (strpos('abc', 'a')) {}

// weak comparisons
if (stripos('abc', 'a') == false) {}
if (strrpos('abc', 'a') == 2) {}

// weak and implicit comparisons
if ($res = preg_match('/abc/', $a)) {}

?>
```

The following pattern are considered legit:

```php
<?php

// explicit comparisons
if (strpos('abc', 'a') === false) {}
if (strripos('abc', 'a') !== true) {}

// explicit comparison and assignation
if (($res = readdir('.')) === false) {}

?>
```
