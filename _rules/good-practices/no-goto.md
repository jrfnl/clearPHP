title:     No Goto
---

`goto` is considered a thing of the past: the code will be much harder to read and understand. It leads to keeping all code in one big heap, code spaghetti and maintenance headaches. 


### Rule Details

The following code is considered a warning:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
meaningfulLabel:
if ($x === 2) {
    goto error;
}
if ($y === 3) {
    goto secondError;
}
normal:
print "x, y and z were tested";
return;

error:
print "x is 1!\n";
return;

secondError:
if ($z === 4) {
	goto normal;
}
print "y is 3!\n";
return;

{% endhighlight %}{: .warning }
