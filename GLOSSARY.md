# break
`break` ends execution of the current `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while` or `switch` structure.

# case
The `case` statement represents one option in a `switch` instruction.

# class
Basic `class` definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.

# constant 
A _constant_ is an identifier (name) for a simple value.

# continue
`continue` is used within looping structures to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and continue execution at the condition evaluation and then the beginning of the next iteration.

# default
The `default` statement represents a catch-all `case` in a `switch` instruction.

# interface
Object `interface` allow you to create code which specifies which methods a class must implement, without having to define how these methods are handled.

# switch
The `switch` statement is similar to a series of IF statements on the same expression. In many occasions, you may want to compare the same variable (or expression) with many different values, and execute a different piece of code depending on which value it equals to. This is exactly what the switch statement is for.

# trait
`Traits` are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP.
